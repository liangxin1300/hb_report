Report tools for HA cluster

## How to run the code[Temporarily]
* Install the HA cluster in 12sp2
* Copy the code to the same directory in cluster 
* "python path/main.py -h" for help

## What have done

* Reuse the code from crmsh.utils
* Testcases with nose

## What still need to do
* The cts stuff
* More platforms(redhat/centos at least)
